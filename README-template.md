## Overview

This is my second frontendmentor project, though it was a fairly easy one I am just 
trying to improve my CSS skills since I cannot move forward and start learning serious 
javascript if I struggle with CSS. I am finding this website pretty cool to practice my CSS skills :)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

- Solution URL: [Add solution URL here](https://your-solution-url.com)
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

oh I was stuck with the problem of indentation of my text and when I realized it a hour later that it is text-align: center which I learned when I was starting with CSS I felt so dumb but maybe it's all part of the project 
other than that I for the first time tried utility classes and they are dope since it reduce your code and simplifies it to some extent

```css
.proud-of-this-css\\ {
  text-align: center;
}
```
